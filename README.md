## Background
Alternative splicing causes generation of distinct mRNA and structural or functional protein isoforms from the single gene. Splicing is conducted by splicesome that is comprised of a complex molecular machinery in the eukaryotic cells. Cancer cells may have cell type specific alterations in the splicing process that can have a prognostic value and can also serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The transcriptomic landscape of the cancer cells engender vulnerability to inhibition of splicing, thereby providing a therapeutic value. sigSPLICE will delineate unique splicing signatures in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer that may serve as biomarkers for cancer detection and or targets for therapeutic intervention. 

## Data

:exclamation: _Discuss the data you used and how it can be accessed._ :exclamation:

## Usage

:exclamation: _How will someone not involved in your project be able to run the code or use it._ :exclamation:

### Installation

:exclamation: _If installation is required, please mention how to do so here._ :exclamation:

Installation simply requires fetching the source code. Following are required:

- Git

To fetch source code, change in to directory of your choice and run:

```sh
git clone -b main \
    git@github.com:u-brite/team-repo-template.git
```

### Requirements
:exclamation: _Note any software used (including Python or R packages), operating system requirements, etc. and its version so that your project is reproducible. It does not have to be in the below format_ :exclamation:

*OS:*

Currently works only in Linux OS. Docker versions may need to be explored later to make it useable in Mac (and
potentially Windows).

*Tools:*

- Anaconda3
    - Tested with version: 2020.02

### Activate conda environment
:exclamation: _Optional: Depends on project._ :exclamation:

Change in to root directory and run the commands below:

```sh
# create conda environment. Needed only the first time.
conda env create --file configs/environment.yaml

# if you need to update existing environment
conda env update --file configs/environment.yaml

# activate conda environment
conda activate testing
```

### Steps to run
:exclamation: _Optional: Depends on project._ :exclamation:

#### Step 1

```sh
python src/data_prep.py -i path/to/file.tsv -O path/to/output_directory
```

#### Step 2

```sh
python src/model.py -i path/to/parsed_file.tsv -O path/to/output_directory
```

Output from this step includes -

```directory
output_directory/
├── parsed_file.tsv               <--- used for model
├── plot.pdf- Plot to visualize data
└── columns.csv - columns before and after filtering step

```

## Results
:exclamation: _If your project yielded or intends to yield some novel analysis, please include them in your readme. It can be named something other than results as well._ :exclamation:
