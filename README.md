## Background
Alternative splicing causes generation of distinct mRNAs from the single gene resulting in various structural or functional protein isoforms. Splicing is conducted by splicesome, a complex molecular machinery in the eukaryotic cells. Cancer cells exhibits cell type specific alterations in the splicing process that invokes a prognostic/therapeutic value or serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The transcriptomic landscape of the cancer cells engender vulnerability to inhibition of splicing, thus can be targeted therapeutically. sigSPLICE will delineate unique splicing signatures in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer that will unravel novel biomarkers for cancer detection and targets for pharmacological intervention.
